### Package Building

Build your own packages:
```sh
# Build Debian package
make package-deb

# Build Arch package  
make package-arch

# Build all packages
make package-all
```

## Usage

### Upload Files

Upload one or more files or directories:

```sh
# Upload a single file
dtlk up myfile.txt

# Upload multiple files
dtlk up file1.txt file2.txt

# Upload directories
dtlk up folder1/ folder2/

# Mixed upload
dtlk up myfile.txt myfolder/ another_file.txt
```

The tool will:
1. Compress all specified files/directories into a tar.gz archive
2. Upload to the server
3. Display an 8-digit file ID for later download

### Download Files

Download files using the 8-digit ID:

```sh
# Download to current directory
dtlk down 12345678

# Download to specific directory
dtlk down 12345678 ./downloads/

# Download to non-existent directory (will be created)
dtlk down 12345678 ./new_folder/
```

The tool will:
1. Download the file from the server
2. Automatically extract the tar.gz archive
3. Handle duplicate files by adding `_dups{number}` suffix if files already exist
4. Clean up temporary files

### Help

```sh
dtlk --help
dtlk help
dtlk -h
```

### Duplicate File Handling

When downloading files, if a file or directory with the same name already exists in the destination, the tool will automatically rename the downloaded item to avoid conflicts:

- Files: `filename.txt` â†’ `filename_dups1.txt`, `filename_dups2.txt`, etc.
- Directories: `dirname` â†’ `dirname_dups1`, `dirname_dups2`, etc.
- Files without extensions: `filename` â†’ `filename_dups1`, `filename_dups2`, etc.

The tool will inform you of any renamed files during the download process.

## Configuration

### Server URL Configuration

The server URL can be configured during installation using `make install`. You can choose between:
- Default server: `https://datalink.ga111o.com`
- Custom server URL of your choice

### Manual Configuration

If you need to change the server URL after installation, you can:

1. **Edit the installed script** (requires sudo):
   ```sh
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/dtlk
   ```
   Find and modify the `SERVER_URL` variable.

2. **Reinstall with different configuration**:
   ```sh
   make uninstall
   make install
   ```

3. **Use local copy** with modified URL:
   Edit the `dtlk` script in your local directory and run it directly:
   ```sh
   ./dtlk up myfile.txt
   ```

## Development

### Testing

Run basic functionality tests:
```sh
make test
```

Create test files for development:
```sh
make dev-test
```

Clean up test files:
```sh
make dev-clean
```
